# GrindsMyBeans
R project to help me grind my beans (for coffee)

In this project we create the functionality to estimate grind setting for the perfect extraction of espresso from a particular espresso machine.
The aim is to find the grind setting which achieves an output time of 25 seconds for 30g of coffee.

This project is a cousin project of [GrindMyBeans.jl](https://github.com/dafitze/GrindsMyBeans.jl), which is written in julia.
