# GrindsMyBeans
R project to help me grind my beans (for coffee)

In this project we create the functionality to estimate grind setting for the perfect extraction of espresso from a particular espresso machine.


This project is a cousin project of [GrindMyBeans](https://github.com/dafitze/GrindsMyBeans.jl), which is written in julia.
